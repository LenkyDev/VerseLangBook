Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices
of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and
you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

TwoSum(Nums:[]int, Target:int):tuple(int, int)=
    var Result:tuple(int, int) := (-1, -1)
    # Basically, for each elem., check against every other elem. to see
    # if it adds up to target, once a match is found, return their indices.
    for (i:int := 0..Nums.Length):
        for (j:int :=0..Nums.Length, i <> j): # Because we cannot use the same element twice.
            if (Nums[i] + Nums[j] = Target):
                set Result = (i, j)
                return Result
    return Result

ExpectedResult:tuple(int, int) := (0, 1)
InputArray:[]int = array{2, 7, 11, 15}

assert:
    Tmp := TwoSum(InputArray,9); Tmp(0) = ExpectedResult(0)
    
assert:
    Tmp := TwoSum(InputArray,9); Tmp(1) = ExpectedResult(1)
